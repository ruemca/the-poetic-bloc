# the-poetic-bloc
web-based poetry generation tool
an English major's computer science project

This page is based on the idea of a digital version of poetry magnets, often found on the refrigerators of creative writers and language lovers, where individual words are displayed on different magnets, and a person can move them around to create phrases and, theoretically, poetry. In digital form, this display relies on a jQuery UI library (https://jqueryui.com/draggable/) to allow the user to move words around on the screen with a simple click-and-drag function. On initially opening the site, the program displays random words within specific part-of-speech categories (nouns, verbs, articles, conjunctions, etc). The user also has the option to generate new words from various themes (nature, queer, space, etc) or refresh the bank of random words to start from scratch. The user can choose to move the words in a grid-structured format, or free-flow within the parent containter.

I hope this site can be entertaining, as well as a potentially useful tool for anyone who enjoys writing poetry but perhaps is daunted by the seemingly endless scope of the English language, or the pressure of an entirely blank page (or screen). 

More updates forthcoming
